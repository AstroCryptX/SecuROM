# AstroCrypt: The Space Hacker's Toolkit

**AstroCrypt** is a cybersecurity and ethical hacking project designed to explore vulnerabilities, secure systems, and research cybersecurity topics through a space-themed lens. This project is for those who want to push the boundaries of both space exploration and security research, focusing on building tools that challenge both the known and unknown.

---

## Features

- **Space-Inspired Hacking Tools**: Unique security tools designed to help ethical hackers in their quest for system exploration, with a cosmic twist.
- **Vulnerability Exploration**: Test and exploit vulnerabilities in a controlled, ethical environment.
- **Cryptographic Research**: Dive into encryption, decryption, and the science of securing data in the digital cosmos.
- **Stealth Mode**: Tools designed to work under the radar, leaving no trace—just like an astronaut in the vastness of space.

## Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine to start using the tools:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AstroCrypt.git
cd AstroCrypt
```

### Requirements

- **Python** (for running some of the core scripts)
- **Node.js** (for web-based tools, if applicable)
- **Other dependencies**: Check the individual tools’ requirements in their folders.
